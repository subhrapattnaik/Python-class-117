Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, is a summarized table used to assess the performance of a classification model. The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarised with count values.



Remember that we have studied the binary type of logistic regression, where the outcome is either True, or False.

In this confusion matrix, the values are as follows -

True Positives - The values that were actually True and were predicted to be True as well
True Negatives - The values that were actually False and were predicted to be False as well
False Positives - The values that were actually False but were predicted to be True.
False Negatives - The values that were actually True but where predicted to be False.

Accuracy
The accuracy of a model is equal to -

True Positives + True Negatives / True Positives + True Negatives + False Positives + False Negatives

--------------------------------------------------------------------


Wrap-up:

we learned about confusion matrix
we saw how to create a confusion matrix and check for the accuracy
in linear regression and multilinear regression
